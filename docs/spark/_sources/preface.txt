About this note
---------------

This is a shared repository for Learning Apache Spark Notes.
The first version was posted on Github in [Feng2017]_.  
This shared repository mainly contains the self-learning and 
self-teaching notes from Wenqiang during his `IMA Data Science
Fellowship`_.

In this repository, I try to use the detailed demo code and 
examples to show how to use each main functions. If you find 
your work wasnâ€™t cited in this note, please feel free to let
me know.

Although I am by no means an data mining programming and Big Data expert, 
I decided that it would be useful for me to share what I learned 
about PySpark programming in the form of easy tutorials with 
detailed example. I hope those tutorials will be a valuable tool 
for your studies.

The tutorials assume that the reader has a preliminary knowledge 
of programing and Linux. And this document is generated automatically
by using `sphinx`_.

Motivation for this tutorial 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I was motivated by the `IMA Data Science Fellowship`_ 
project to learn PySpark. After that I was impressed and attracted by the
PySpark. And I foud that:

 #. It is no exaggeration to say that Spark is the most powerful
    Bigdata tool.
 #. However, I still found that learning Spark was a difficult
    process. I have to Google it and identify which one is true. 
    And it was hard to find detailed examples which I can easily
    learned the full process in one file. 
 #. Good sources are expensive for a graduate student.  


Acknowledgement
+++++++++++++++

At here, I would like to thank Ming Chen, Jian Sun and Zhongbo Li at the 
University of Tennessee at Knoxville for the valuable disscussion
and thank the generous anonymous authors for providing the detailed
solutions and source code on the internet. Without those help, 
this repository would not have been possible to be made. Wenqiang 
also would like to thank the `Institute for Mathematics and Its 
Applications (IMA)`_ at `University of Minnesota, Twin Cities`_ 
for support during his IMA Data Scientist Fellow visit.

Feedback and suggestions
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Your comments and suggestions are highly appreciated. I am more
than happy to receive corrections, suggestions or feedbacks through
email (wfeng1@utk.edu) for improvements.
