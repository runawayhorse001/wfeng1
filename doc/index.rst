I am a Data Scientist within `DST`_’s Applied Analytics Group. Before joining DST, I was an IMA Data Science Fellow at The Institute for Mathematics and its Applications (IMA) at the University of Minnesota. 

I graduated from `University of Tennessee`_, Knoxville, with Ph.D. in Computational Mathematics and Master’s degree in Statistics. He also holds Master’s degree in Computational Mathematics from Missouri University of Science and Technology (MST) and Master’s degree in Applied Mathematics from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).


If you have great interest in Big Data, Deep Learning and Datamining, you might find some useful information from my `Learning Apache PySpark`_ and `Data Mining With Python and R Tutorials`_. Thanks Georg Brandl and the Sphinx team for developing the open source package Sphinx .
